      <h1>That Pixel Design is so Hot Right Now</h1>

    <p>There’s a certain comfort, and often inherent cool, in things categorized as “retro.” A ’69 Ford Mustang. A greaser pompadour. Betty White. Pixel design.

    It’s no secret that pixel art is experiencing a resurgence in the digital form by way of video games like Mojang’s Minecraft and Superbrothers’ Sword & Sworcery. The latter game afforded me some inspiration; from what I was seeing online, the style of pixel art it brought to the masses—and popularized in the tangible realm by artists like Michael Myers from drawsgood—increasingly defined the style, and constraints, pixel art was created under. “Ever wonder what the Star Wars characters would look like pixelized?” Elongated single-pixel limbs, very stylized body shape. “[x designer] shows us what The Avengers would look like in pixel form!” Elongated single-pixel limbs, very stylized body shape.

    This got me to thinking of the varied styles and creations of pixel desktop icons from the mid ’90s. During that timeframe, customizing your Mac’s interface was easy and open, and doing so spoke as much to personalization as it did to thumbing your nose at the beige PC towers that defined the norm. While control panels such as Kaleidoscope quickly skinned your entire UI with a single click, some of us dove into desktop iconography, crafting pixel-based mini-mosaics under ridiculous constraints: 256 colors on a 32x32 grid, made in the resource editing app ResEdit.</p>

    <h2>The lost medium of pixel art</h2>
    If you’re under 30, you’re likely unaware of, or have very finite exposure to, the origins of pixel-based desktop icon design.

    ResEdit itself was rudimentary, yet incredibly robust. Last officially released by Apple in 1994, it was primarily a tool for developers to create and edit resources in the resource fork architecture Macs used to rely on. One such resource, “ICON,” was our focus. Pixel by pixel, we employed common practices as the means to incredibly disparate stylistic ends:
    <ol>
      <li>Manually dithering via finite tonal variations to simulate depth</li>
      <li>Stacking pixel units of a shape’s outline conservatively, to avoid “jaggies” and smooth edges</li>
      <li>Faux anti-aliasing of harsh edges via the six available non-alpha-transparent grey swatches</li>
    </ol>
